Growth Compass: A Prescriptive Marketing Analytics Platform
Growth Compass is an end-to-end data science project that moves beyond standard predictive modeling to answer a more powerful question: "Which customers should we target to maximize the impact of our marketing campaign?"

Standard classification models can predict who is likely to convert, but they fail to distinguish between customers who would have converted anyway ("Sure Things") and those whose behavior is directly influenced by the marketing action. This project solves that problem by using uplift modeling to identify the "Persuadables"â€”the specific customer segment whose conversion is dependent on receiving the promotion.

By focusing marketing efforts exclusively on this group, businesses can achieve a significant increase in campaign Return on Investment (ROI) and reduce wasteful spending.

The Interactive Dashboard
The core of this project is a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit. It allows non-technical users (e.g., marketing managers) to leverage the power of the uplift model without writing a single line of code.

Key Dashboard Features:
Dynamic Cost-Benefit Analysis: Interactively adjust campaign parameters like the cost per promotion and the value of a conversion.

Easy Data Upload: Upload a CSV file of new customers to be scored.

Instant Recommendations: The dashboard automatically scores all customers and visualizes the results:

A Profit Curve that pinpoints the optimal number of customers to target for maximum profit.

Key business metrics on Maximum Potential Profit and Optimal Customer Reach.

A sortable and downloadable list of the highest-uplift customers to target.

ðŸ’¡ Methodology: The Two-Model Uplift Approach
This project uses a classic and robust method for calculating uplift that relies on the stable and well-documented scikit-learn library.

Data Segmentation: The training data is split into two distinct groups based on the historical experiment:

Treatment Group: Customers who received the marketing promotion.

Control Group: Customers who did not receive the promotion.

Independent Model Training: Two separate RandomForestClassifier models are trained:

Model_T learns the patterns and probability of conversion for customers in the treatment group.

Model_C learns the baseline probability of conversion for customers in the control group.

Uplift Score Calculation: For any new customer, the uplift score is calculated as the difference in the predictions from the two models:
Uplift Score = P(Convert | Model_T) - P(Convert | Model_C)

This score represents the true, incremental lift in conversion probability generated by the marketing intervention, providing a clear signal for targeting decisions.

Step-by-Step Installation and Usage Guide
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine. These steps are compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Prerequisites
Python: Ensure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed. You can download it from python.org. During installation on Windows, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

Git: You will need Git to clone the repository. You can download it from git-scm.com.
DOWNLOAD DATASET FROM : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bofulee/kevin-hillstrom-minethatdata-e-mailanalytics?resource=download

Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to download the project files:

git clone https://github.com/aneesh-vishwa/Growth-Compass.git
cd growth-compass


Step 2: Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
It is a strong best practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts.

On macOS / Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

On Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

You will know the virtual environment is active when you see (venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt.

Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Install all the necessary Python libraries using the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Train the Uplift Model
Run the main.py script to process the data, train the two models, and save them to the models/ directory.

python main.py

This step only needs to be done once, or whenever you want to retrain the model on new data.

Step 5: Launch the Interactive Dashboard
You can now launch the Streamlit web application.

streamlit run app.py


Feed data\new_customers_to_score.csv as an dummy data in the Streamlit web UI to see the results
